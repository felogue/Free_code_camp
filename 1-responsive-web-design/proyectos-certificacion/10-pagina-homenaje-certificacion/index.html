            <h2>Here's a time line of Dr.Borlaug's life:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Birth:</strong>March 14, 1879, in Ulm, in the Kingdom of WÃ¼rttemberg of the German Empire.
                </li>
                <li><strong>1895:</strong>At age 16, Einstein moved to Switzerland, where he would later study at the
                    Federal Polytechnic School in Zurich.</li>
                <li><strong>1900:</strong>He graduates from the Polytechnic School and begins to work at the Bern Patent
                    Office.</li>
                <li><strong>1905: </strong>He publishes four seminal articles in the journal Annalen der Physik,
                    including his theories on the photoelectric effect (for which he would win the Nobel Prize) and the
                    special theory of relativity. This year is known as your "Annus Mirabilis" or miraculous year.</li>
                <li><strong>1915:</strong>He presents the general theory of relativity, which provides a new description
                    of gravity.</li>
                <li><strong>1921:</strong>Receives the Nobel Prize in Physics for his explanation of the photoelectric
                    effect, which confirmed quantum theory and transformed the understanding of physics.</li>
                <li><strong>1933:</strong>Due to the rise of the Nazi regime in Germany, Einstein emigrates to the
                    United States, where he becomes a professor at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton, New
                    Jersey.</li>
                <li><strong>1940</strong>He becomes a US citizen, also maintaining his Swiss citizenship.</li>
                <li><strong>1945:</strong>After the end of World War II and the use of the atomic bomb, Einstein becomes
                    an advocate for nuclear arms control and a peaceful world.</li>
                <li><strong>1955: </strong>He died on April 18 in Princeton, New Jersey, United States.
                    Einstein is remembered not only for his contributions to physics but also for his activism against
                    racism, his humanitarian philosophy, and his influence on the philosophy of science. His legacy
                    remains alive and continues to inspire scientists and thinkers around the world.</li>
            </ul>
